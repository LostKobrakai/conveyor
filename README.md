Command-line tool to easily run tests agains multiple versions of [ProcessWire CMF](https://processwire.com).

Are you building a module, or a template and you need to make sure it works in all supported ProcessWire versions? Then `conveyor` is exactly what you need. Write the tests in any fashion you like (PHPUnit, CodeCeption, Kahlan, ...). Then tell `conveyor` which ProcessWire versions you are interested in and it will do the rest for you.
